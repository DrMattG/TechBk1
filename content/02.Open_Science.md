# Opening the Gates of Management and Science 

<!-- Leader: Chloe Nater; co-leaders: Matt Grainger, and Erlend Nilsen -->

## Openness to diversity of knowledge 

Wildlife research and management are closely entwined fields with a large number of different stakeholders. Not only that, but the stakeholders typically represent a highly diverse group of actors with complimentary knowledge and expertise relevant to the wildlife systems and/or management challenges at hand. 
This diversity of knowledge can be illustrated through the -- admittedly very vague -- concept of "expert knowledge".
In the eyes of the general public it may be the researchers that come to mind first when thinking about "experts" [dommett2019; funk2019]. Researchers collect and analyze data in order to provide a (quantitative) knowledge base for decision-making. Modern science is becoming increasingly more collaborative and typically involves teams of researchers with different and complimentary skills and backgrounds [+ref]. 
At the same time, there is a growing awareness in the scientific community of the need for interdisciplinary work that also makes use of what is often termed "expert knowledge" in scientific work [+ref]. When used by a researcher, the term "expert" often refers to any non-researcher who possesses valuable knowledge (in the context of a study/problem). In wildlife research, this often encompasses managers and citizen scientists, and sometimes also indigenous people. 
Wildlife managers, sometimes also referred to as "end users", "decision makers", or "policy makers", 


- Managers
- Citizen scientists
- Indigenous people/knowledge
- Modern science = teamwork, capitalizes on harnessing diversity


## Engagement of diverse stakeholders 

Harnessing and making optimal use of the diversity of available knowledge surrounding wildlife and wildlife management requires broad involvement of different stakeholder groups. Collaboration is key, and this necessitates that the entire process -- from data collection to policy implementation -- is inclusive. Four principles form the basis of inclusivity in this context:  openness, accessbility, transparency, and reproducibility. These principles are also the corner stones of open science [Hampton et al. 2015, Powers et al. 2019, Vicente-Saez et al. 2020].
Open processes are clearly visible and offer opportunities for anyone to engage with them and contribute. Accessible processes are set up and documented in a way that allows everyone to obtain information relevant to them and be able to understand both the information itself and the way it was generated. Transparent processes feature complete documentation of every step of the workflow (this includes data collection, analysis, and presentation but also resulting decision-making) and provide all materials that informed and are produced by them. Finally, the mark of reproducible processes is that they are provided as complete workflows and based on tools that everyone can access, meaning that anyone (possessing relevant knowledge) can re-run the workflow and arrive at the same conclusions. 
Robust decision-making based on diverse knowledge thus requires workflows that are open, accessible, transparent, and reproducible and the next section provides and overview over the components of such workflows (Figure X).
