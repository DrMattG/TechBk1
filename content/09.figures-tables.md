![Example study designs distributing experimental (E) and control (C) study plots across patches varying in habitat quality. High-quality patches are green while low-quality plots are blue. Study designs differ in how they control for extraneous envrionmental variation: not accounting for envrionmental variation (A), accounting for environmental variation by restricting the effects to a single level of habitat quality (B), or accounting for environmental variation through blocking across levels of habitat quality (C).](images/BlockingFigure.png){#fig:blocking}

![Example R-code showing the effects of controlling variation through restricting sampling and blocking. In this example, we wish to assess the effects of insecticides on the body mass of red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus). Study plots are distributed across 8 different forest patches which vary in habitat quality.](images/Rcode.png){#fig:Rcode}

![Example R-code for controlling extraneous variation during statistical analyses. In this example, age-related differences in late-summer of survival of mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are of interest; however, body size (as measured by wing length) and food abundance also affect survival.](images/Rcode2.png){#fig:Rcode2}

![A target population of greater sage-grouse (*Centrocercus urophasianus*, hereafter grouse) in one county in Wyoming, USA. For reasons like accessibility and permission, the whole county area could not be used for conducting a study. So, the sampling frame represents the area from which sampling units could be collected.](images/Fig6.1.png){#fig:Fig6.1}
