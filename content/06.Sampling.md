The ecological question often revolves around measuring relevant biological variables (survival, density, etc.) on items (like populations, species, subspecies, etc.) of interest in the system under study. In these questions, researchers conduct studies to obtain accurate estimates of characteristics that are important for management and conservation decisions. A vast amount of literature on the subject of **sampling or finite population sampling** (Cochran 1963) exists to help researchers in planning these studies.

The set of all possible individuals from which processes and patterns are to be deduced is called the **target population**. Rarely in any ecological studies, a census of the population is possible. Even in the case of rare and critically endangered species (less in number) or the case of immobile organisms like plants, collecting data from the whole population can be impossible. Thus, in most cases, researchers study a **subset of the population (sample)** and use collected information to draw inferences about the target population. The sample therefore can be described as a group of individuals who participate in research and represent the whole population. In more scientific terms, a sample is a subset of a population randomly selected based on some probabilistic design. In ecological studies, we often hear the term **sampling frame (or study area)**. To efficiently design these studies, it is necessary to understand what this term means. It is a finite set of all individuals that could be measured, and we can use different sampling schemes to obtain items from this frame. The sampling frame usually coincides with the target population, but reasons like accessibility, logistics, budget, etc. can make it differ otherwise. From this sampling frame, we draw a subset or sample of individuals, the **sampling units**, and the items to be measured for different biological variables. Sampling units should be distinct and easy to define (Box 1, Fig. 1). Target population does not always mean the number of animals. It can also be described in terms of geographic area, in which case, the sampling unit would be grids or township or county depending on the research question.

Sampling is a critical part of both descriptive and experimental studies. All field studies require appropriate sampling designs to reduce variation among observations in the study. The choice of sampling method will depend on the objectives of the study, the distribution, and characteristics of the population being sampled among many other factors.

For reasons like accessibility and permission, the whole county area could not be used for conducting a study. So, the sampling frame represents the area from which sampling units could be collected.

### Probability and non-probability sampling methods

For a sample to correctly represent a population, we need to properly identify the target population, followed by identifying the sampling frame, sampling units, and sampling technique. We should also be cautious about resource availability-manpower, logistics, time, etc. So, the next question here is how to draw a sample. There are mainly two types of sampling methods: probability and non-probability sampling. These designs differ in terms of the quality of parameter estimates (Box 2).

**Probability sampling**: In the probability sampling scheme, every unit from the sampling frame has a non-zero probability of selection. It, therefore, leads to unbiased estimates of the mean and variance for the variable of interest. Therefore, any method aimed at generalizing results drawn by a sample to the whole population of interest must be based on probability sampling.

**Non-probability sampling**: In non-probability sampling, researchers select samples based on their convenience. In other words, the researchers purposively choose particular units for constituting a sample. Social researchers often use this sampling design to select households or families to conduct their surveys. A few common techniques are **convenience sampling** and **judgment sampling**. In convenience sampling, samples are chosen based on an arbitrary selection procedure. It is often justified based on accessibility and availability of resources like time, budget, etc. In wildlife studies, this sampling scheme is often used for conducting roadside bird surveys, surveys for identifying mammal tracks near roads, etc. Since the location of the target species decides the sampling frame and number of samples, the results from these studies are often highly biased and far from accurate. In judgment sampling, sampling frame, and samples are chosen based on expert knowledge of the system. One common example from wildlife studies is selecting and classifying **study area (sampling frame)** into low-quality and high-quality based on expert knowledge about the area.

There are pros and cons for each of these sampling designs. Probability sampling helps in reducing sample bias and therefore provides an accurate representation of the population. Non-probability sampling is useful when we still need some preliminary data within time and budget constraints.

### Sampling designs under the probability sampling method

Although simple random sampling is the most basic technique for sample selection, there are others that are often used in wildlife ecology studies. There are pros and cons associated with each of these designs and they can also be combined to provide a larger set of options for study designs.

**Simple random**: Simple random sampling is the process of selecting n units from a population of N units such that every unit has an equal probability of inclusion in the sample. Simple random sampling requires that each sample unit be selected independently of all other units. This method should be used if the area of interest is homogeneous with respect to the elements and characteristics of interest. A simple random sample may be obtained by following basic steps: 1) the study area must be completely covered by non-overlapping sampling units, 2) the population of sampling units is assumed to be finite, 3) sampling units can be located and the measurement of the characteristic of interest on the unit is possible. Also, the error in measuring should be small compared to the differences in the attribute from unit to unit, and 4) sample units are sampled without replacement. For example, suppose a farmer is interested in evaluating the health of his cattle, and each of them is ear tagged. So, under simple random sampling, he can generate some random number using a calculator or excel sheet and select those tagged cattle for health assessment.

**Systematic**: Systematic sampling is the process where sampling units are selected at regular intervals. Under this sampling technique, the sampling frame will be partitioned into n number of primary units and then the selection of units will occur in a systematic fashion based on a random start. This design is easier to execute than simple random sampling. In the above example of assessing cattle health, systematic sampling will be easier to implement in case the cattle are not ear-tagged. Then under systematic design, the farmer can choose every nth cow while they are entering the barn (assuming they follow a queue). Systematic sampling is commonly used to sample vegetation characteristics. For example, determining vegetation characteristics every 10 meters along a line transect in a plot is a classical example of systematic sampling. Systematic sampling has also been criticized in cases when the arrangement of units may follow some pattern in the response variable. For example, let's say we were interested in the number of people using public areas for birding. We decided to establish a check station and take a count using a systematic sample of days during the study period. This could give us a biased result if every sampled day fell on a work week, then the estimates obtained would be very different from estimates obtained from the weekend count.

**Stratified**: In wildlife studies, populations tend to be aggregated or clustered, thus sample units closer to each other will be more likely to be similar. For this reason, systematic sampling tends to overestimate the variance of parameter estimates. A uniform grid of points or parallel lines may not encounter rare units. To increase the likelihood of capturing some of these rare units, scientists may stratify the sample such that all units of each distinct type are joined together into strata and simple random samples are drawn from each stratum. Stratified sampling is, therefore, generally used when the population from which the sample is to be drawn does not belong to one homogeneous group and there is a high variation within the population. If, however, the population belongs to a heterogeneous group, the estimates based on earlier sampling designs will be imprecise. If we have prior information associated with the heterogeneity in the population, we can use designs like stratified sampling to select samples which will increase estimates precision. This sampling technique divides the whole population into different mutually exclusive groups (strata) according to some characteristics such as the habitat they inhabit, gender, etc. Ideally, the strata should be homogeneous with respect to the variable of interest (like density, abundance, etc.). This process requires more effort than random sampling but is generally more accurate in terms of representing the population. There is also a limit to the number of strata into which a population can be subdivided. The stratified sampling method is common in wildlife studies, as it helps estimate and contrast parameters among strata. The formal procedure of stratified sampling follows a few steps: 1) specify strata, which must be mutually exclusive, 2) classify all sampling units into their stratum, and 3) draw a simple random sample from each stratum.

**Cluster**: A probabilistic sampling scheme in which each sampling unit is a cluster of items such as the group of animals. Cluster sampling is generally used in cases when there are predefined groups within the population. These groups can be based on demographics, habitats, geography, etc. The sampling process starts by dividing the population into small groups known as clusters followed by random selection of these clusters to create a sample. This approach has wide applications in wildlife study as many birds and mammals occur in groups during or all parts of the year. Cluster sampling is useful when the cost or time to travel from one sample unit to the next is too high. Cluster sampling can also be performed in stages. Single-stage cluster sampling happens when all the elements of the chosen clusters are included in the sample. Two-stage cluster sampling is when in contrast to single-stage cluster sampling only some units are observed. The formal procedure of cluster sampling follows a few steps: 1) specify appropriate clusters and make a list of all clusters, 2) draw a simple random sample of clusters, and 3) measure all elements of interest in each selected cluster.

**Adaptive sampling**: In various studies, numerous sampling designs are combined under an adaptive sampling framework. In this technique, we start with an initial probabilistic sample of units and add more units in some pre-defined neighborhood or pre-defined condition to this sample (Thompson and Seber 1996, Williams et al. 2002, Thompson 2003). This process continues until no sampled units satisfy the specified condition. Adaptive sampling offers biologists a way to augment the probability sample with samples from other units without losing the benefits of the original probabilistic design. Rules for the selection of additional samples are established based on some characteristic of the variable of interest (e.g., presence/ absence, age, sex, and height).

**Case study**: Scientists are worried that ongoing human-induced landscape changes have threatened a grouse population in eastern Wyoming, USA. They decided to conduct a study with two main objectives. They primarily want to understand the impact of this dynamic landscape on the survival of grouse and on lek numbers. The study will be done in Carbon County for a period of 3 years during which they plan to capture 150 grouse in total (both male and female; Fig 5a). For carrying out this study, they divided the study area into 25 equal-sized grids (Fig. 5b). To estimate the survival of grouse, we need to capture individuals and track them for the required time period or till they are alive, whichever comes first. We need to devise a sampling mechanism to select grids from where these grouse can be captured.

**Fig. 5** a) Carbon County in Wyoming, USA for conducting a 3-year study on a grouse population in the sampling frame, b) Study area divided into 25 equal-sized grids for carrying out the study.

In this case study, we will show you how researchers can sample grids using different types of probabilistic sampling schemes. Under random sampling, each of the grids will have an equal probability of getting sampled (Fig. 6a). In a systematic sampling framework, researchers can pick grids at regular intervals. So let's say, they decided to select every 5th grid starting with the 3rd grid. So, 3, 8, 13, 18, and 23 will be their plots from which the grouse will be then captured (Fig. 6b).

Suppose researchers identified three different dominant land cover types (grassland, wetland, and forest), so the random selection of grids can follow a stratified framework. Under this framework, researchers will divide the whole study area into these different strata and then randomly select grids from each of these strata to capture grouse (Fig. 6c).

Lek sites are known to be spatially close to each other. So, we would expect that if a lek is inhabiting one primary sample plot (grid), there are other leks in the neighborhood. So here researchers can use cluster sampling to calculate lek numbers. Under single-stage cluster sampling, they would start by randomly selecting primary sample plots across the study area, then within those primary plots, conduct surveys to calculate all lek numbers within the cluster of all four secondary plots (Fig. 6d). In our example, grids can act as primary plots. In each primary sample plot, there are 4 secondary sample plots (numbered 1 to 4 in some order), so under two-stage cluster sampling, we will randomly select any 2 from these 4 secondary sample plots (Fig. 6e). We will then conduct surveys to calculate lek numbers in 2 of these secondary sample plots.

Under adaptive cluster sampling, we will start with the grids which have the highest number of leks and then will sample the next grids with a similar number of grouse (Fig. 6f). See Box 3 for R codes for each of these sampling designs.

### Sampling methodology

In wildlife studies, there are a few commonly used sampling methodologies.

**Plots**: Plots are widely used to study habitat characteristics, vegetation characteristics, counting animal numbers, etc. Plots' shape can vary from circular to square and represents a geographically defined target population. Wildlife tends to be distributed nonrandomly across the landscape in correspondence to the distribution of their habitat. Their distributions are further impacted by intraspecific and interspecific interactions. Given that distributions and abundance vary, plots should vary in shape and size depending on the studied species. Numerous factors influence plot size, including the biology of the species, their spatial distribution, study objectives, logistical considerations, and cost constraints. For example, larger species with large home ranges require larger plots to include adequate numbers. A 3,500-ha plot might include only 10% of the home range of a grizzly bear (*Ursus arctos horribilis*), the same area could include the entire home ranges of multiple white-footed mice (*Peromyscus leucopus*). Krebs (1999) listed three main approaches to determining optimal plot shape and size for a study: 1) plot size should have the highest precision for a specific study area, 3) plot size which is most accurate and efficient to answer the question of interest, and 3) plot size which is logistically easy to construct and use.

**Points**: In point sampling, a set of points is established throughout the population, and measurements are taken from each point. A common example is a point-count survey for birds where the distance to each heard or seen bird species of interest is measured from a particular point. Selection of sample points can follow any sampling design, as long as points are spaced apart enough that overlapping of the population between points is a bare minimum.

**Transects**: In line transects a line or series of lines is randomly or systematically located in the study area. Objects are recorded on either side of the line according to some rule of inclusion. The observer traverses each line, recording the perpendicular distance from the line to each detected animal. These distances are used to estimate the effective width of the area sampled by the transect. Transects can be established using any sampling design as long as each of them is treated as an independent observation and are non-overlapping.
