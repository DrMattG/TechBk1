# How to contribute?

## Requirements

0.1. A free, personal [Github Account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) is necessary to contribute to this project.

0.2. Become familiar with the concepts and functions of repository, issue, issue template, manuscript source, and pull-request. Visit the [Getting started](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/USAGE.md#getting-started) section from the [USAGE.md](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/USAGE.md) for a brief summary on these main concepts!


## Contributing with writing

1. To situate yourself, access the [current document](https://drmattg.github.io/TechBk1/) and/or its corresponding sections within the [content](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/tree/main/content) directory;

2. It is **essential** that you **always keep your version up-to-date** (_i.e._ always *fetch* and *pull* from the origin), so you are certain to not provide changes to a previous version of the manuscript. The easiest ways to being modifying are to:
   1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1) to your Github profile, and contribute your modifications from there. *Remember to always fetch upstream to keep your repository up-to-date*.; or,
   2. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1) to your computer, create and work from your own [branch](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1) and push your committed modifications through [pull requests]https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/USAGE.md#pull-requests). *Always fetch and pull from the origin when you work, so your local copy is updated.*

3. Write text and propose changes to a file by making a pull request:
   1. **Write a sentence per line** and create new paragraphs with two returns;
   2. It is *highly* encouraged to commit frequently, so you can finely track and, if necessary, revert changes.
   3. Add relevant descriptive names to commits and pull requests;
      1. Preferred: `Adding a sentence on open data `;
      2. Not preferred: `adding text`, `Typo fix`,`Aaaargh!!` 
   4. For further information about `Markdown` formatting, access the [`USAGE.md`](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/USAGE.md) document.

4. All pull requests must be reviewed before being merged to the `main` repository. You may **assign reviewers** if you would like someone to specifically review your pull requests. See the [Reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reviewing-writing) section for more information;

5. Would you like to point to something important, make a question or a suggestion? Begin a conversation in the [Discussions](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/discussions);

6. Fill in your author information by initiating a pull request on the [`metadata.yaml`](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/content/metadata.yaml) file. 

## Reviewing writing

All pull requests should be reviewed by, at least, one of the other contributors. Pull request reviews can be open, so that anyone can review them. However, you may assign specific reviewers to them.

When reviewing a pull request, one needs to consider:

1. Whether the pull request passed all Manubot checks. Green means good. Red means that there are things that must be solved *before* merging the text to the main manuscript. [See here for more information](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/blob/main/USAGE.md#pull-requests).

If you feel that there are issues in the pull request that needs to be broadly discussed, you should write a comment below and write an [issue](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/issues), while tagging the pull request you have made.

## Opening new discussions

Any type of discussion related to this project is welcome! You can visit the [Discussions](https://github.com/DrMattG/TechBk1/discussions) section of this repository and begin from there.

You can search for topics and even propose new categories!

We can consider that issues are tasks that need to be addressed, are *not* permanent, and thus are made to be closed. 

> Important: _If you would like to provide changes to files that are not related to the `content` directory, please open a descriptive issue and only perform prospective changes through pull requests._
