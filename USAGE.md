# Getting started

## Git, committing changes and making pull requests

Git is a tool that allows one to track changes made to documents over time. In GitHub, Git provides us with the power of tracking the contribution of different users and collaborate in and manage how modifications should be merged and incorporated to the main project.

## Fundamentals

## Git vocabulary

- [Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories). A repository is usually used to organize a single project.  

- [Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#creating-a-branch). Each repository contains one or several branches, which allows one to have different versions of a repository at one time. Our default branch for the `chapter` repository is the `main` one. There are also the `gh-pages` and `output`, which contain the `HTML` and `PDF` versions that are frequently created by the Manubot. You will also see other branches that correspond to the working versions of other contributors. These personal branches can be merged to the `main` branch, so that their edits are passed to the `main` manuscript. Once in a while, branches that have been merged and are no longer modified will be safely deleted (to keep things tidy!). 

- [Making and committing changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#making-and-committing-changes). Change to files are arbitrarily grouped together and associated to a message through [**commits**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits). 

   - For instance, once you add or change a sentence of the manuscript, you can commit them and add a message `Added the discussion about X with its citation.`. 
   
   - Each commit has a unique identifier (called a SHA or hash) and both the commit and the commit message allow contributors to identify who made the changes, when they were made, and which were the specific changes. 
   
   - When making a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes. 
   
   - In certain circumstances, commits are the reference for the deletion or reversion of commits that are no longer necessary.
   
   - For commits to be passed to the online repository, they must be **pushed**. Commits from other contributors that were pushed to the online repository can come to your local versions (either in your computer or in your Github profile) through **pull**s. Good practice is to always **pull** before you **push**.

- [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) a repository. You can fork a repository to your Github profile, so you can keep fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. **Forks** are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. One of the main ways to provide changes to this chapter, is by:

    1. Forking this repository;
    
    2. Regularly committing changes to the files and pushing them to your local version of this repository; and,
    
    3. Submitting a pull request to the `main` repository, so that others can review, merge and incorporate your changes.
    
    - You must always keep your fork up-to-date with the `main` repository. You can do this by accessing your version of this repository in your Github profile and [fetching upstream](). See the example below:
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145310697-f335c381-c57a-458e-94e3-14e098eaa1b9.png)

- [Cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) a repository. **Cloning** a repository is similar to forking, with the main difference being that the copy of the repository is in your local computer, instead of your Github profile. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com.

     - You can [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository);
     
     - There are tools that can help you track changes with cloned repositories from your computer. You are free to choose whichever you prefer (*e.g.*, RStudio, Atom, Visual Basic). 
     
     - You must always keep your cloned repository up-to-date with the online version. Do this by *fetching* and *pulling from the origin*, as below:
     
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145312669-de1a1713-5bd1-4cd8-bdc6-426a0f862320.png)
     
     After clicking *Fetch origin*, it will show how many commits you must *pull from the origin*.
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145314441-fa18d587-121c-4357-9968-11bdc33e9475.png)
     

- [Making a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Pull requests let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the `main` branch. This section will deserve its own topic. See more below!

## Pull requests

As mentioned above, changes to the content of the manuscript and to this repository require you to:
1. Fork or clone this repository;
2. Regularly commit changes to the files and push these commits to your local version of this repository; and,
3. Submit a pull request to the `main` repository, so that others can review, merge and incorporate your changes to the `main` version of the chapter.

### Step-by-step guide on creating pull requests

0. Create your local branch and select it as your main working environment.

1. Commit your changes, with a relevant *Commit message* and with a *Description* explaining the changes happening in that commit (e.g., whether they solve an issue or something):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145317090-061430d6-487a-4ed0-8e54-740f6a6fc64a.png)

2. Push your commits to your branch:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145317405-4383ba48-e8ef-4989-b581-514ab5e91d90.png)

3. Once you are done with the changes you intended to do, create a pull request:
   1. Click on the **Pull request** button:
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145317527-77d531b2-6d33-49d3-b37b-dde648716280.png)

   2. Create your pull request. Do not forget to briefly explain your changes, which will be reviewed by other contributors. You may also assign specific reviewers, if you would like to: 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145317852-13ce9a14-4957-47b9-b692-3aef2b417147.png)

   3. Once created, Manubot will evaluate if the pull request passes all error checks:
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145318022-a584a00a-19be-4731-9fb4-14782b41fdf6.png)

   A green checkmark (tick) confirms that everything has worked fine.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599229/145318310-9c53fe5f-d0b3-4e39-8e71-93bd9faa73ad.png)

   4. Your pull request will be reviewed by one other contributor, who will discuss, provide or request new changes, or directly merge and close your pull request with the `main` repository. Below, another contributor evaluated the pull request and requested corrections to be made. The assignee for the pull request then provided the requested changes by pushing commits to the same branch that concerns the pull request.

# Manubot usage guidelines

This repository uses [Manubot](https://manubot.org) to automatically produce a manuscript from the source in the [`content`](content) directory.
Check out the [Manubot catalog](https://manubot.org/catalog/) for examples of what is possible when writing with Manubot.
Try editing the [demo manuscript](https://github.com/manubot/try-manubot) to quickly test Manubot formatting and citations.

## Manubot markdown

Manuscript text should be written in markdown files located in the [`content`](content) directory.
Markdown files are identified by their `.md` extension and ordered according to their two-digit prefix (e.g. `01.`, `02.`, … `99.`).

For basic formatting, check out the [CommonMark Help](https://commonmark.org/help/) page for an introduction to the formatting options provided by standard markdown.
In addition, Manubot supports an extended version of markdown, tailored for scholarly writing, which includes [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) and the extensions discussed below.

The `content/02.delete-me.md` file in the Rootstock repository shows many of the elements and formatting options supported by Manubot.
See the [raw markdown](https://gitlab.com/manubot/rootstock/blob/main/content/02.delete-me.md#L) in this file and compare it to the [rendered manuscript](https://manubot.github.io/rootstock/).

Within a paragraph in markdown, single newlines are interpreted as whitespace (same as a space).
A paragraph's source does not need to contain newlines.
However, "one paragraph per line" makes the git diff less precise, leading to less granular review commenting, and makes conflicts more likely.
Therefore, we recommend using [semantic linefeeds](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/ "Semantic Linefeeds. Brandon Rhodes. 2012") — newlines between sentences.
We have found that "one sentence per line" is preferable to "word wrap" or "one paragraph per line".

### Tables

Manubot supports [markdown tables](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/ "GitHub Help: Organizing information with tables").

```md
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| value_a | 1 | 47 |
| value_b | 2 | 56 |

Table: Caption for this example table. {#tbl:example-id}
```

Support for table numbering and citation is provided by [`pandoc-tablenos`](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-tablenos).
Above, `{#tbl:example-id}` sets the table ID, which creates an HTML anchor and allows citing the table like `@tbl:example-id`.
For easy creation of markdown tables, check out the [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) webapp.

### Figures

Figures can be included with the following markdown:

```md
 
![Caption for the example figure.](url_or_path_to_figure){#fig:example-id}
```

The blank line before the figure is required.
Support for figure numbering and citation is provided by [`pandoc-fignos`](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos).
This figure can be cited in the text using `@fig:example-id`.
In context, a figure citation may look like: `Figure {@fig:example-id}B shows …`.

For images created by the manuscript authors that are hosted elsewhere on GitHub, we recommend using a [versioned](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/) GitHub URL to embed figures, thereby preserving exact image provenance.
When embedding SVG images hosted on GitHub, it's necessary to append `?sanitize=true` to the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL.
For example:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/scihub/572d6947cb958e797d1a07fdb273157ad9154273/figure/citescore.svg?sanitize=true
```

Figures placed in the [`content/images`](content/images) directory can be embedded using their relative path.
For example, we embed an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) icon inline using:

```md
![ORCID icon](images/orcid.svg){height="13px"}
```

The bracketed text following the image declaration is interpreted by Pandoc's [`link_attributes`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-link_attributes) extension.
For example, the following will override the figure number to be "S1" and set the image width to 5 inches:

```md
{#fig:supplement tag="S1" width="5in"}
```

We recommend always specifying the width of SVG images (even if just `width="100%"`), since otherwise SVGs may not render properly in the [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) PDF export.

### Citations

Manubot supports [Pandoc citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations), but with added support for citing persistent identifiers directly.
Citations are processed in 3 stages:

1. Pandoc parses the input Markdown to locate citation keys.
2. The [`pandoc-manubot-cite` filter](https://github.com/manubot/manubot#pandoc-filter) automatically retrieves the bibliographic metadata for citation keys.
3. The [`pandoc-citeproc` filter](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md) renders in-text citations and generates styled references.

When citing persistent identifiers, citation keys should be formatted like `@prefix:accession`,
where `prefix` is one of the options described below.
When choosing which source to use for a citation, we recommend the following order:

1. DOI (Digital Object Identifier), cite like `@doi:10.15363/thinklab.4`.
   Shortened versions of DOIs can be created at [shortdoi.org](http://shortdoi.org/).
   shortDOIs begin with `10/` rather than `10.` and can also be cited.
   For example, Manubot will expand `@doi:10/993` to the DOI above.
   We suggest using shortDOIs to cite DOIs containing forbidden characters, such as `(` or `)`.
2. PubMed Central ID, cite like `@pmc:PMC4497619`.
3. PubMed ID, cite like `@pubmed:26158728`.
4. _arXiv_ ID, cite like `@arxiv:1508.06576v2`.
5. ISBN (International Standard Book Number), cite like `@isbn:9781339919881`.
6. URL / webpage, cite like `@https://nyti.ms/1QUgAt1`.
   URL citations can be helpful if the above methods return incorrect metadata.
   For example, `@doi:10.1038/ng.3834` [incorrectly handles](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/158) the consortium name resulting in a blank author, while `@https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3834` succeeds.
   Similarly, `@https://doi.org/10.1101/142760` is a [workaround](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/16) to set the journal name of bioRxiv preprints to _bioRxiv_.
7. Wikidata Items, cite like `@wikidata:Q50051684`.
   Note that anyone can edit or add records on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), so users are encouraged to contribute metadata for hard-to-cite works to Wikidata.
8. Any other compact identifier supported by <https://bioregistry.io>.
   Manubot uses the Bioregistry to support [hundreds](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/blob/a4af68125ab6bb322fdfb1689cfeec09f0cb1b60/manubot/cite/handlers.py#L155-L1485 "Actual prefix support is determined by this manubot source code.") of [prefixes](https://bioregistry.io/registry/ "Bioregistry prefix search").
   For example, citing `@clinicaltrials:NCT04280705` will produce the same bibliographic metadata as `@https://bioregistry.io/clinicaltrials:NCT04280705` or `@https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705`.
9. For references that do not have any of the above persistent identifiers,
   the citation key does not need to include a prefix.
   Citing `@old-manuscript` will work, but only if reference metadata is [provided manually](#reference-metadata).

Manubot is able to infer certain prefixes,
such some citations can be formatted like `@accession` (without a prefix).
Examples includes DOIs like `@10.15363/thinklab.4` or `@10/993`,
PMC / PubMed identifiers like `@PMC4497619` or `@26158728`,
arXiv identifier like `@1508.06576v2`,
and Wikidata identifiers like `@Q50051684`.
To disable citekey prefix inference, add the following to `metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
pandoc:
  manubot-infer-citekey-prefixes: false
```

Cite multiple items at once like:

```md
Here is a sentence with several citations [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.4; @pubmed:26158728; @arxiv:1508.06576; @isbn:9780394603988].
```

Note that multiple citations must be semicolon separated.
Be careful not to cite the same study using identifiers from multiple sources.
For example, the following citations all refer to the same study, but will be treated as separate references: `[@doi:10.7717/peerj.705; @pmc:PMC4304851; @pubmed:25648772]`.

The citation key syntax is described in the [Pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax):

> Unless a citation key start with a letter, digit, or `_`,
> and contains only alphanumerics and internal punctuation characters (`:.#$%&-+?<>~/`),
> it must be surrounded by curly braces,
> which are not considered part of the key.
> In `@Foo_bar.baz.`, the key is `Foo_bar.baz`.
> The final period is not *internal* punctuation,
> so it is not included in the key.
> In `@{Foo_bar.baz.}`, the key is `Foo_bar.baz.`, including the final period.
> The curly braces are recommended if you use URLs as keys:
> `[@{https://example.com/bib?name=foobar&date=2000}, p. 33]`.

If a citation key does not fully match [this online regex](https://regex101.com/r/mXZyY2/latest)
(for example, contains characters such as `;` or `=` or end with a non-alphanumeric character such as `/`),
make sure to surround it with curly braces or use the [citation aliases](#citation-aliases) workaround below.
<!-- See [jgm/pandoc#6026](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6026) on the curly-brace syntax for Markdown citation keys, which was introduced in Pandoc 2.14. -->

Prior to Rootstock commit [`6636b91`](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/commit/6636b912c6b41593acd2041d34cd4158c1b317fb) on 2020-01-14, Manubot processed citations separately from Pandoc.
Switching to a Pandoc filter improved reliability on complex documents, but restricted the syntax of citation keys slightly.
Therefore, users upgrading Rootstock may find some citations become invalid.
By default, `pandoc-manubot-cite` does not fail upon invalid citations, although this can be changed by adding the following to `metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
pandoc:
  manubot-fail-on-errors: true
```

#### Citation aliases

The system also supports citation aliases, which map from one citation key (the "alias" or "tag") to another.
Aliases are recommended for the following applications:

1. A citation key contains forbidden characters.
2. A single reference is cited many times.
   Therefore, it might make sense to define an alias, so if the citation updates (e.g. a newer version becomes available), only a single change is required.

Aliases can be defined using Markdown's [link reference syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#link-reference-definitions) as follows:

```markdown
Citing a URL containing a `?` character [@my-url].
Citing a DOI containing parentheses [@my-doi].

[@my-url]: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg
[@my-doi]: doi:10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2
```

This syntax is also used by [`pandoc-url2cite`](https://github.com/phiresky/pandoc-url2cite).
Make sure to place these link reference definitions in their own paragraphs.
These paragraphs can be in any of the content Markdown files.

Another method for defining aliases is to define `pandoc.citekey-aliases` in `metadata.yaml`:

```yaml
pandoc:
  citekey-aliases:
    my-url: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkwoSDPgg
    my-doi: doi:10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80360-2
```

## Reference metadata

Manubot stores the bibliographic details for references (the set of all cited works) as CSL JSON ([Citation Style Language Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#csl-json-items)).
Manubot automatically generates CSL JSON for most persistent identifiers (as described in [Citations](#citations) above).
In some cases, automatic metadata retrieval fails or provides incorrect or incomplete information.
Errors are most common for references generated from scraping HTML metadata from websites.
This occurs most frequently for `https`/`http`/`url` citations as well as Bioregistry prefixes without explicit support listed above.
Therefore, Manubot supports user-provided metadata, which we refer to as "manual references".
When a manual reference is provided, Manubot uses the supplied metadata and does not attempt to generate it.

Manubot searches the `content` directory for files that match the glob pattern `manual-references*.*` and expects that these files contain manual references.
[`content/manual-references.json`](content/manual-references.json) is the default file to specify custom CSL JSON metadata.
Manual references are matched to citations using their "id" field.
For example, to manually specify the metadata for the citation `@https://github.com/manubot/rootstock`, add a CSL JSON Item to `manual-references.json` that contains the following excerpt:

```json
"id": "https://github.com/manubot/rootstock",
```

The metadata for unhandled citations — any citation key that is a not a supported persistent ID — must be provided in a manual reference file (e.g. `manual-references.json`) or an error will occur.
For example, to cite `@private-message` in a manuscript, a corresponding CSL JSON Item is required, such as:

```json
{
  "id": "private-message",
  "type": "personal_communication",
  "title": "Personal communication with Doctor X"
}
```

All manual references must provide values for the "id" and "type" fields.
For guidance on what CSL JSON should be like for different document types, refer to [these examples](https://github.com/aurimasv/zotero-import-export-formats/blob/a51c342e66bebd97b73a7230047b801c8f7bb690/CSL%20JSON.json).

Manubot offers some support for other bibliographic metadata formats besides CSL JSON, by delegating conversion to the `pandoc-citeproc --bib2json` [utility](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md#convert-mode).
Formats are inferred from filename extensions.
So, for example, to provide metadata for `@https://github.com/manubot/rootstock` in BibTeX format, create the file `content/manual-references.bib` and create an item whose definition starts with the excerpt:

```latex
@misc{https://github.com/manubot/rootstock,
```

Processed reference metadata in CSL JSON format, either generated by Manubot or specified via manual references, is exported to `references.json`.
This file is located in the `output` branch on GitHub or in the `output` subdirectory of local builds.
The "id" field in `references.json` and in the final manuscript uses a shortened ID that is derived from the original ID.
For debugging information, see `citations.tsv`, which shows citation identifiers as they progress through the processing pipeline.
In order to freeze all references, rather than have Manubot regenerate them during future builds, copy the `references.json` output file to `content` with a filename matching the `manual-references*.json` pattern.
One tip is to embed the date `references.json` was generated into the frozen manual reference filename, like `content/manual-references-2019-06-21.json`.

## Manuscript metadata

[`content/metadata.yaml`](content/metadata.yaml) contains manuscript metadata that gets passed through to Pandoc, via a [`yaml_metadata_block`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block).
`metadata.yaml` should contain the manuscript `title`, `authors` list, `keywords`, and `lang` ([language tag](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/ "W3C: Language tags in HTML and XML")).
Additional metadata, such as `date`, will automatically be created by the Manubot.
Manubot uses the [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) specified in [`build.sh`](build/build.sh) for setting the manuscript's date.
For example, setting the `TZ` environment variable to `Etc/UTC` directs the Manubot to use Coordinated Universal Time.

We recommend authors add themselves to `metadata.yaml` via pull request (when requested by a maintainer), thereby signaling that they've read and approved the manuscript.
The following YAML shows the supported key–value pairs for an author:  

```yaml
github: dhimmel  # strongly suggested
name: Daniel S. Himmelstein  # mandatory
initials: DSH  # optional
orcid: 0000-0002-3012-7446  # mandatory
twitter: dhimmel  # optional
email: daniel.himmelstein@gmail.com  # suggested
affiliations:  # as a list, strongly suggested
  - Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania
  - Department of Biological & Medical Informatics, University of California, San Francisco
funders:
  - GBMF4552  # optional list of author's funding
```

Note that `affiliations` should be a list to allow for multiple affiliations per author.

### Thumbnail

A thumbnail is an image used to visually represent the manuscript,
such as when a manuscript is shared on social media or added to the [Manubot catalog](https://manubot.org/catalog/).
Specify a thumbnail in any of the following ways:

1. placing an image named `thumbnail.png` anywhere in the manuscript repository (for example, in the root directory).
2. setting `thumbnail` in `metadata.yaml` to a path, relative to the repository root, where the image file is located.
    Example:
    ```yaml
    thumbnail: build/assets/thumbnail-1000x1000.png
    ```
3. setting `thumbnail` in `metadata.yaml` to an absolute URL where the image is located.
    Example:
    ```yaml
    thumbnail: https://github.com/greenelab/meta-review/raw/master/thumbnail.png
    ```

Methods 2 and 3 take precedence over method 1.
View the [guidelines here](https://github.com/manubot/catalog#thumbnail-guidelines) for suggestions on how to create a good thumbnail.
Key points are that thumbnails should be 1000 × 1000 pixels, PNG formatted, and striking.

## Custom formatting

Modifying the manuscript formatting requires modifying the CSS in the file [`build/themes/default.html`](build/themes/default.html).
Common formatting changes, such as [font size](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues/239) and [double spacing](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues/244), can be found by searching the [Rootstock issues](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues).
Open a [new issue](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues/new) if you have a new formatting question.

Changing the citation style or which interactive HTML plugins are loaded requires editing the options specified by Pandoc defaults files in [`build/pandoc/defaults`](build/pandoc/defaults).
The citation style is determined by the Citation Style Language file specified in [`common.yaml`](build/pandoc/defaults/common.yaml):

```yaml
metadata:
  csl: build/assets/style.csl
```

The value for `metadata.csl` can be a URL, allowing access to thousands of existing styles hosted by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/styles) or the [CSL GitHub](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles).
For example, the following options replace the Manubot citation style with the _PeerJ_ style:

## Spellchecking

When the `SPELLCHECK` environment variable is `true`, the pandoc [spellcheck filter](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/tree/master/spellcheck) is run.
Potential spelling errors will be printed in the continuous integration log along with the files and line numbers in which they appeared.
Words in `build/assets/custom-dictionary.txt` are ignored during spellchecking.
Spellchecking is currently only supported for English language manuscripts.
