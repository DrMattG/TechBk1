# Opening the Gates of Management and Science 

<!-- Leader: Chloe Nater; co-leaders: Matt Grainger, and Erlend Nilsen -->

## Openness to diversity of knowledge 

- Diversity of knowledge = collection of different actors with (complimentary) knowledge relevant to system / problem at hand
- Diversity illustrated through the (very vague) concept of "expert knowledge"
- In public view: researchers = experts
- Researcher's knowledge and role, diversity within research
- What researchers call "expert knowledge" gives more insights into knowledge diversity: expert = everyone who has valuable knowledge but is not a researcher
- Managers
- Citizen scientists
- Indigenous people/knowledge
- Modern science = teamwork, capitalizes on harnessing diversity


## Engagement of diverse actors 

- Harnessing diversity of knowledge requires broad involvement in and broad accessibility of process
- Inclusivity and collaboration are key
- Four principles are central: openness, accessbility, transparency, and reproducibility
- These principles are also the corner stones of open science
- Openness = process is visible and offers clear options for contributing
- Accessibility = process is set up and documented in a way that allows everyone to a) get desired level of info and b) understand information relevant to them
- Transparency = documentation is complete, all materials available, all decisions described
- Reproducibility = workflows are provided in their entirety and based on tools everyone can access. Means that in theory, anyone can reproduce results. 
- Robust decision-making based on diverse knowledge requires workflows adhering to open (science) principles


## Open and accessible workflows
